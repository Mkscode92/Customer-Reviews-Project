To do for the next couple of weeks: 
- Using the amazon reviews csv file for our project, will be the dataset that our models will be based on 
- We need to be able to grab the scores and use that to make visual graphs to visualize the csv data 
- We need to use either vader or roberta to be able to understand the sentiment behind text in the reviews 
- We need to be able train a model to use these results in addition to the scores (rating, helpfulness, etc) to make a final prediction about a specific review given by a random dude (a custom review containing the rating, helpfulness score, and the review text itself) 
- We should attempt to use multiple machine learning types to see how effective each model type is even though we know that roberta will probably be the best. Itâ€™s because this is a long term project, and we should try to explore as many possible solutions as we can for comparison uses. 
- Brainstorm extra things that we can do with these materials 

PRIORITY - we need every member to download our csv file dataset of amazon reviews from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?resource=download
